CSS Social Media Buttons
==========================

A set of 50 social media buttons made with CSS, that can be added with just one HTML element. They're retina proof, 36 pixels (excluding shadow) in diameter, come in two types (normal and flat) and in four styles (square, rounded, round, bordered).

## Installation ##

Simply put the CSS file in your project CSS folder and link to it in your `<head>` or copy/paste the content of the `csmb.css` into your own CSS file:

Not using all the buttons? You can compile your own CSS file that suits your needs with SASS. Open `csmb.scss` and remove/comment out the list appends (see line 183) you don't need. Compile the SASS file and add the resulting CSS to your project.

You can also turn off button styles and/or types that you won't use, to keep the size of the CSS file small. This can be done by changing `true` to `false` for the various options starting at line 42.


## How to use ##

Add an HTML element (`<a>`, `<span>` or `<button>`) with the class `csmb` or `csmb-flat`:

	<a href="#" class="csmb">CSS Social Media Button</a>
	<span class="csmb-flat">CSS Social Media Button</span>
	<button class="csmb">CSS Social Media Button</button>

Add a class of a (social) network, like for example `github` (see *'Lists of available classes'* below for all the possibilities):

	<a href="#" class="csmb github">GitHub profile: username</a>
	<span class="csmb-flat github">GitHub profile: username</span>
	<button class="csmb github">GitHub profile: username</button>

However, this will only get you the base square buttons. You can extend the base styling with three styles: `csmb-border`, `csmb-rounded` and `csmb-round`. `csmb-border` can be combined with one of the other two styles.

	<a href="#" class="csmb csmb-border github">GitHub profile: username</a>
	<span class="csmb-flat csmb-rounded github">GitHub profile: username</span>
	<button class="csmb csmb-round csmb-border github">GitHub profile: username</button>

**Alternative buttons**

Some buttons have an alternative version, that use another icon (`github`) and/or different color button (`youtube`).

If the alternative version only has a different icon add `alt` as extra class:

	<a href="#" class="csmb github alt">GitHub profile: username</a>
	<span class="csmb-flat github alt">GitHub profile: username</span>
	<button class="csmb github alt">GitHub profile: username</button>

For alternative versions with a different color button (like `youtube`) the old (pre 1.3.1) classes are used:

	<a href="#" class="csmb youtube-alt">YouTube channel: username</a>
	<span class="csmb-flat youtube-alt">YouTube channel: username</span>
	<button class="csmb youtube-alt">YouTube channel: username</button>

## Changelog v.2 ##

**v.2.1.0**

- Added five new buttons (browsers): `chome`, `safari`, `opera` (all three on white background), `firefox` (on light blue background) and `ie` (on blue background).
- Added darker inner border on the `:hover`, `:focus` and `:active` states of `.csmb-border` buttons.
- Changed colour of white buttons (for example: `flickr` and `github`) to `#F4F4F4`.
- Replaced absolute pixel values with percentage values for the `:after` and `:before` width and height properties.
- Replaced absolute pixel values with percentage values for the border-radius properties: 25% for `.csmb-rounded` and 50% for `.csmb-round`.

**v.2.0.0**

- Renamed `Round Social Media Buttons` to `CSS Social Media Buttons`: as it has become more than just round buttons.
- Moved all styling to just one file: *'One file to rule them all'*.
- Removed LESS version: LESS can't do everything SASS can, for example lists, which is essential for the *'One file to rule them all'* structure.
- Changed the way buttons are added: using lists (SASS version of arrays) instead of importing files. You can still remove/comment out the buttons you don't want to compile.
- Added variables to turn on/off certain button types and styles, making the compiled CSS smaller.
- Implemented "*rule*" that a button can only have one alternative button and that an alt button must be more than just a different color (this was the case for `bitbucket`, `drupal` and `wordpress` for example). This has resulted in the removal of some alternative buttons: see *Removed buttons* section.
- **[Experimental]** Added extra style for `<button>` elements: this is turned off by default because some browsers (IE8 and Opera) seem to have difficulty with `:before` and `:after` on this element.

Button changes:

- Renamed `social-btn` to `csmb`.
- Added new button type: `csmb-flat`.
- Added three button styles: `csmb-border`, `csmb-rounded` and `csmb-round`.
- Added text-indent so you can add text for SEO/accessibility purposes within the element without it being shown.
- Moved icon from the `:after` layer to the base layer.
- Moved gradient from the base layer to the `:after` layer.
- Moved inset box-shadow from the `:after` layer to the base layer.
- Moved `:hover`, `:focus` and `:active` to only apply to anchor and button elements.

Added buttons:

- Added `blogger`: white icon on orange background.
- Added `delicious`: blue & black block on white background.

- Removed `wordpress alt` button: the white icon on grey background.
- Removed `youtube alt` button: the red play icon on white background.

Icon changes:

- Resized icons to be a bit smaller as to better fit the different types of buttons (especially the round without border buttons). Affected buttons: `bitbucket`, `facebook`, `github`, `github-alt` `instagram-alt`, `myspace`, `pinterest`, `tumblr`, `twitter-alt`, `vimeo`, `vine`, `wordpress`, `wordpress-alt` and `youtube-alt alt`.
- Removed light blue line from `facebook alt` button.
- Changed the `mail` icon: made the line narrower at the left and right side to make the illusion of an open envelope.
- Fixed positioning of `vimeo` and `vine` icon: they weren't in the middle of the button.
- Fixed icon of `github-alt`: the head of the octocat wasn't in the middle of the button anymore because of the resize.
- Fixed icon of `foursquare`: the white swoop stopped to early causing a empty space between the icon and the button borders (especially at square buttons).

Colour changes:

- Changed colour of buttons to match values from [Brandcolours.net](http://brandcolours.net/). Affected buttons: `facebook`, `foursquare`, `gplus`, `imdb`, `instagram-alt`, `lastfm`, `linkedin`, `path`, `pinterest`, `rss`, `skype`, `tumblr`, `vimeo`, `yelp` and `youtube-alt`.
- Changed colour of `wordpress` button from `#EBEBEB` (white) to `#21759B` (blue)
- Changed colour of white buttons (for example: `flickr` and `github`) to `#F8F8F8`.
